        Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing each other.
        <br /><br />
        Bend forward until your torso is nearly parallel to the floor and hold
        the dumbbells below you with fully extended arms. Row the dumbbells back
        towards your hip by driving your elbow towards where a rear pocket would
        be. Keep the elbow by your side throughout the movement. Pull until your
        upper arm is in line with your torso and hold this position briefly.
        Lower the dumbbells back to the start position, allowing your shoulders
        to protract and your arms to fully extend.
