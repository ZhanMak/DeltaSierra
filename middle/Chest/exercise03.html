        Start by taking two smaller weight plates or similar and pressing them
        together between your hands.
        <br /><br />Your arms should be extended outwards in front of you. While
        actively pinching the plate together and not letting them slip apart,
        pull the plates towards your sternum as you keep your chest up and
        shoulder blades pulled together. Flex your chest and press the weights
        back outwards. Keep the plates pressed together and the inner chest
        muscles engaged.
