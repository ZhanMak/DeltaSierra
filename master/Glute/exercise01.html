        Place barbell on your upper back with a close grip. Take a comfortable
        stance, place your feet between hip and shoulder-width apart and turn
        your feet outward to whatever angle feels natural. From here, inhale
        into your belly and feel your weight distribute evenly across your feet.
        Squat by bending your knees and hips simultaneously and sitting down as
        low as you are able. Once you reach the bottom, reverse the motion and
        stand back up by contracting your quads.
