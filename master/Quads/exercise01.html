      <p>
        With a barbell on your back or a pair of dumbbells in each hand, place
        your feet very close together while your heels are significantly
        elevated. Brace your core and slowly squat down, allowing your knees to
        travel well beyond your toes until your hamstrings touch your calves.
        Stay as vertical as possible. Return to the starting position by
        contracting the quads only, maintaining a still posture in your torso
        and hips.
