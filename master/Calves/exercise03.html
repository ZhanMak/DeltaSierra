        Pick a jump rope that fits you correctly, so when you stand in the
        middle of the rope, both handles need to reach your armpits.
        <br /><br />
        Adjust accordingly. Hold a handle in each hand with rope behind you. To
        move the rope, rotate your forearms forward. Then use your wrists to
        swing the rope overhead. When the rope is overhead, bend your knees.
        When the rope is at shin height, spring up from the balls of your feet
        to jump over the rope. Start slowly until you get the hang of it. Make
        sure to stay on the balls of your feet the entire time.
